Evoplex is a multi-agent system for [networks (graphs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). Here, each agent is represented as a node in the network and is constrained to interact only with its neighbours, which are linked by edges in the network.

**Wait, another multi-agent system?** Why not using something like [MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) or [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)?
Yes, there are hundreds of options out there, but I bet none of them can do what Evoplex does!

In fact, most of the existing pieces of software are not good enough. Main issues include: really old technologies, unmaintained code, inflexibility, poor performance and others. Thus, over the last years, people often prefer to develop their own solutions from scratch. However, we know that reinventing the wheel is always time-consuming, expensive and usually a terrible strategy.

In this way, we decided to create Evoplex! An extremely fast, multi-threaded, user-friendly, cross-platform and truly modular application.

Evoplex was originally developed to tackle problems in the field of [Evolutionary Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_graph_theory). However, it has been used in a wide range of scenarios, including:

 * [Evolutionary Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_dynamics)
 * [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)
 * [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
 * ... the applications are endless!
