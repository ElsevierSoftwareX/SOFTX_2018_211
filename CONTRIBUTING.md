# Contributing to Evoplex

:+1::tada: Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Evoplex! :tada::+1:

There are many ways that you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Asking questions and providing feedback

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please use our Google group. You can ask on the [web interface](https://groups.google.com/group/evoplex) or send an email to evoplex@googlegroups.com (mailing list).

If chat is more your speed, you can join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/EvoplexMAS/evoplex).

We also use the [@evoplexmas](https://twitter.com/EvoplexMAS) account on Twitter to announce releases (follow us).

## Reporting issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Evoplex? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as efficiently as possible.

### Look for an existing issue

Before you create a new issue, please search for [open issues](https://github.com/evoplex/evoplex/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing good bug reports and feature requests

**Do not** enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue. File a single issue per problem and feature request.

**Do not** add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful in reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

## Contributing to code

Before contributing to code, please read the [Git workflow](https://github.com/evoplex/evoplex/wiki/Git-Contributor-Workflow) and our [coding conventions](https://github.com/evoplex/evoplex/wiki/Coding-Style-Guide) in the wiki. You may also be interested in looking at the instructions to [build Evoplex from source code](https://github.com/evoplex/evoplex/wiki/Build-from-Source-Code).

Be aware that by contributing to the code base, you are agreeing that Evoplex may redistribute your work under our [LICENSE](https://github.com/evoplex/evoplex#license).

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Evoplex will generally not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
Suggest your change on [Github issues](https://github.com/evoplex/evoplex/issues) to collect feedback about the change and start writing code.

## Thank You!
Your contributions to open source, large or small, make great projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
